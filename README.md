**Brief Overview: Predicting Student Performance Using Academic and Demographic Data**

Predicting student performance involves using machine learning or statistical methods to forecast academic outcomes (e.g., grades, pass/fail) based on data such as test scores, attendance, gender, age, and parental background. The process includes collecting and cleaning data, selecting relevant features, training predictive models (like decision trees or logistic regression), and evaluating accuracy. This approach helps educators identify at-risk students early and support personalized learning strategies.
